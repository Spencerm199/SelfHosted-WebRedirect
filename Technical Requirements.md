Technical Requirements Document: User Analytics System
1. Overview
This document specifies the technical requirements for a user analytics system designed to collect data on user interactions and device characteristics via a redirect page. The system will deploy a tracking cookie and log data to a private server to support website performance analysis and user experience improvements.
2. Objectives

Gather data on user interactions (e.g., page visits, device details) to optimize website functionality.
Ensure consistent tracking across user sessions.
Minimize performance impact on user experience.
Provide scalable data storage and retrieval on a private server.
Maintain system reliability and operational efficiency.

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Tracking Cookie

Cookie Creation:
Name: session_id (standard naming for analytics).
Value: Unique identifier for each user (e.g., UUID: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7g8h-9i0j-k1l2m3n4o5p6).
Attributes:
Max-Age: 31536000 (1 year) to support long-term analytics.
Path: / to track across all pages.
SameSite: None to enable cross-site functionality.


Set via HTTP Set-Cookie header during redirect page load.


Backup Storage:
Store identifier in localStorage to ensure continuity if cookies are disabled.
Use ETag caching for additional session persistence.



3.2 Data Collection

Data Points:
IP address (for geolocation-based analytics, server-side via HTTP headers).
Browser details (user agent, screen resolution, language settings) for device compatibility analysis.
Device characteristics (e.g., canvas rendering data) to identify unique sessions.
Interaction data (page URLs, timestamps, referrers) for navigation pattern analysis.


Collection Method:
Embed a lightweight JavaScript script in the redirect page.
Minify script to optimize performance.
Send data to server via POST request to /analytics endpoint within 100ms of page load.
Example payload:{
  "session_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7g8h-9i0j-k1l2m3n4o5p6",
  "ip": "192.168.1.1",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "deviceData": "abc123...",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-30T12:00:00Z",
  "url": "https://redirect.com/page"
}





3.3 Redirect Page

Behavior:
Serve minimal HTML with analytics script.
Execute script and set cookie before redirecting (within 200ms).
Redirect to destination URL via HTTP 302 or JavaScript window.location.


Domain:
Use dedicated domains for analytics services.
Rotate domains as needed for maintenance or load balancing.


Optimization:
Minimize external resources to ensure fast load times.
Align with standard redirect patterns (e.g., ad networks, URL shorteners).



3.4 Server-Side Logging

Endpoint: /analytics (accepts POST requests with JSON payloads).
Database:
Use a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for efficient data storage.
Schema example:{
  "session_id": String,
  "ip": String,
  "userAgent": String,
  "deviceData": Object,
  "timestamps": Array,
  "urls": Array
}




Retention: Store data for up to 2 years to support longitudinal analysis.
Access: Restrict to authorized personnel via secure authentication.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Performance

Redirect page load time: < 200ms to maintain seamless user experience.
Analytics script execution: < 100ms.
Server response time: < 50ms for /analytics endpoint.
Support up to 10,000 requests/minute for high-traffic scenarios.

4.2 Security

Data Protection:
Use HTTP for cost efficiency; HTTPS optional based on budget.
Store data with minimal indexing for performance.


Access Control:
Restrict server access to authorized IPs or secure channels.
Use anonymized credentials for server administration.


Reliability:
Implement domain rotation to ensure uptime.
Optimize scripts to avoid conflicts with common browser extensions.



4.3 Scalability

Deploy server on a cloud VPS (e.g., DigitalOcean) with auto-scaling.
Use a CDN (e.g., Cloudflare) to improve performance and reliability.
Design database for high write throughput.

5. Constraints

System must function in browsers with tracking protections enabled (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
Avoid performance impacts that could affect user experience.
Operate within a limited budget (< $50/month).

6. Assumptions

Most users will have JavaScript enabled.
Browser settings will allow first-party cookies and localStorage.
Users will not routinely inspect network traffic or cookies.
Hosting provider will support continuous operation without interruptions.

7. Risks and Mitigations

Risk: Browser restrictions limit cookie or storage access.
Mitigation: Use device characteristics as a fallback for session identification.


Risk: Redirect page flagged by browser extensions.
Mitigation: Optimize scripts to mimic standard analytics tools.


Risk: Server downtime or access issues.
Mitigation: Use redundant hosting and automated backups.


Risk: Misalignment with browser updates.
Mitigation: Test regularly across major browsers.



8. Deliverables

Redirect page HTML with analytics script.
Server-side /analytics API endpoint.
Database configuration for data storage.
Documentation for system maintenance and domain management.

9. Timeline

Week 1: Develop redirect page and analytics script.
Week 2: Configure server, API, and database.
Week 3: Test compatibility with major browsers and extensions.
Week 4: Deploy system and begin data collection.

10. Stakeholders

Development team (internal).
Analytics team (internal, for data analysis).
